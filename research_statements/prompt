I am Weihai Shen, a PhD student specializing in distributed systems.

I am preparing to apply for faculty positions this year and am currently writing my research statement. You can find my background and publications on my homepage: https://shenweihai1.github.io/. For reference, I have also included a simple draft of my research statement (./Weihai_Research_Statement.pdf) to help you better understand my current research focus.

I have already gathered 10+ faculty research statements for you to review. Please study ALL these carefully first (ignore Weihai_Research_Statement.pdf). Using them as examples, write me a detailed, well-structured, and compelling research statement in Markdown format. Take your time—do not rush.

Specific guidelines:

Do not make “Depfast” a major section, as it is not my first-author work. Focus on Rolis and Mako.

Avoid common mistakes: uncommon or unnecessary headings/titles; no industry internship details. Learn from others samples!

Avoid duplicated content. Keep it concise. 

Use highlighting strategically—not only for section titles but also for key sentences. Use italics where emphasis is needed.

Before, you produce your final version, please RE-READ all other research statements to revise your final version.

I know there is no “perfect” version, but I expect a clean, polished version that reflects careful thought and avoids obvious structural issues.

Output final version into a markdown format.


It looks not too bad now; I take a quick pass and make several changes in "Weihai_rs.tex" using format \changebars{new content}{old content}. The major issue is you always make some claims that come from nowhere. Please according to my suggestions, revise my research statement again by reading my papers (depfast-atc22.pdf, mako-osdi25.pdf, and rolis-eurosys22.pdf).
